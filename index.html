        <p class="description">
 
          I’m a technical writer with experience in a
          variety of industries. Because I’m naturally curious and
          inquisitive, I’m able to learn quickly about new-to-me
          technologies. I have written and edited a variety of
          documents, from PowerPoint presentations and proposals to
          man pages with user guides, developer guides, and more. I have exceptional communication skills with an
          emphasis on interpretation and translation of specialized
          language and concepts into easy-to-understand,
          well-structured text for a wide variety of audiences.

		I researched and wrote this technical blog post for
		Addrex using Microsoft Word and Wordpress after having
		conversations with the sales team. The sales team
		repeatedly has to explain how use Network Address
		Translation (NAT) to prepare and sell Internet
		Protocol (IP) address blocks in the company’s online
		marketplace and wanted a short article with all the
		information a C-suite executive would need to
		recommend NAT to their technical team. I worked with
		the sales team and technical product team to verify
		the information and the technical approach.

              I created this template and process using Microsoft Word
              for the Information Technology & Services (IT&S) group
              at Neustar, which was receiving very bad customer
              ratings for outages in the company’s Number Portability
              Access Center (NPAC), a contract the company won from
              the FCC and the telecommunications industry. In addition
              to that, the company was audited quarterly by Ernst and
              Young to verify that it was a neutral third-party in
              the industry; both the auditors and the industry
              requested that this process be documented. The initial
              draft I composed of this document satisfied the
              neutrality audit but the stakeholders (C-suite
              executives, Network Operations Center, Network group,
              Application Support, Information Security, the Customer
              Help Desk) and I agreed that there was room to improve
              the process and response time. This was the final draft
              that we negotiated internally, which was approved by the
              stakeholders and passed the subsequent neutrality audit.

                I created this FrameMaker template for release and
                patch notes for DSET Corporation so that other
                technical writers could create these documents. Only
                the first 3 pages of the document are included in the
                writing sample. Instructions for using the template
                are included in the text.
